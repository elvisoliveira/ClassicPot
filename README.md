# ClassicPot
Ragnar√∂k Online macro script made with [AutoIt](https://www.autoitscript.com/) to monitor and automate the consumption of healing and recovering items. This code was build to work with the international classic client, but it can be adapted to work with other servers as well.

## Dependencies
As the script relies on memory check to get status information of the character, it is required to include **NomadMemory.au3** in the folder, because this is not a default extension for **AutoIt**.

## License
This is not my code and i could not find the author. The solemn reason of this repository is to enable others to continue the development.
